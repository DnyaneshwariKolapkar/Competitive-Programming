# Advanced Data Structures - Remember

### Segment Trees
* Focus on states of sub-problem that a single node should solve.
* Always think of optimising Merge_Complexity.
* Build Complexity - O(N x Merge_Complexity)
* We should be solve every query in O(logN) complexity.

### Fenwick Tree

### Binary Lifting
* Used on trees for efficient jumping(DP)
* Build Complexity - O(NlogN)
* Query Complexity - O(logN)
